        "**Huffman Coding** is a greedy algorithm used for data compression. It assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequencies in the input data, ensuring that no code is a prefix of another. This results in optimal compression for a given set of character frequencies.\n",

        "   - Create a new node with these two nodes as children.\n",
        "   - Assign the new node a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes' frequencies.\n",
