        "The **Branch and Bound (B&B)** technique is a systematic way to solve optimization problems, particularly those involving combinatorial structures like the 0/1 knapsack problem, traveling salesperson problem, and more. It is particularly useful for solving problems where a brute-force approach would be computationally expensive.\n",

        "2. **Bounding**: Calculate a bound (upper or lower) for the best possible solution in a branch. If the bound is worse than the current best solution, prune the branch.\n",
        "3. **Branching**: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems by branching on choices (e.g., include or exclude an item in the knapsack).\n",
